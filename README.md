# Temperature-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Predicting the temperature of your system based on factors such as RAM usage,CPU storage temperature,Memory Used and space consumed by the applications(load).
Dataset is obtained by using the application open hardware system, is available for free download.This application generates data of your system on various parameters including time scale(can be used for time series approach,not done in this project). As you on using the system, the values in the dataset will be changing.
In this project we applied 4 regression models:
  1.Multiple Linear Regression
  2.Polynomial Regression
  3.Random Forest(Most accurate results for our dataset).
  4.SVM.
